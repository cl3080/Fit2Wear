# Fit2Wear

## Background
Youâ€™re on the data science team at Rent the Runway. Your customers pay a monthly fee in which they receive four items of clothing per month. A recent customer satisfaction survey found that the greatest reason of customer churn was ordering an item that did not fit well. Vanity sizing plagues the clothing industry and so two items with the same dress size can have wildly different fits.  

At Rent the Runway, roughly 26% of clothese don't fit well as shown in the following piechar, which can cause a significant amount of customers cancel their memberships.

So, the purpose of this case study is to build a model that empowers a user to discover whether a given item at a give size is likely to fit loosely, well, or tightly.
