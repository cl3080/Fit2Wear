# Fit2Wear

# Background
You’re on the data science team at Rent the Runway. Your customers pay a monthly fee in which they receive four items of clothing per month. A recent customer satisfaction survey found that the greatest reason of customer churn was ordering an item that did not fit well. Vanity sizing plagues the clothing industry and so two items with the same dress size can have wildly different fits.  

1. Which items have the truest fit? What does that mean?
2. Are some categories of clothing more significantly more prone to have ill-fitting clothes? 
3. Build a model that empowers a user to discover whether a given item at a given size is likely to fit loosely, well, or tightly. 
4. How would you design a model that also takes in a user’s previous history into making your decision? If time permits, build this. 
5. While this data is anonymized, Rent the Runway, like all companies in retail, handles sensitive and highly personal information about their customers. What is the tradeoff between the confidence of your inference and the information you collect in the context of this business problem.
